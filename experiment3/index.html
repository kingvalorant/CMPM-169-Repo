			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>What are you trying to accomplish with this experiment?</p>
				<p>I want to accomplish user interaction seamlessly in two natural phenomena imitations.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?</p>
				<p>In the Circle class, I applied the repelling force in the avoid() function, adjusting it based on distance, updated movement and stored past positions in update(), and cleared trails in wrapPosition() to prevent sudden lines when stars wrapped around the screen.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</p>
				<p>Ran into one issue where my circles would bounce off walls and create sharp lines from the point of contact, but it wasn't a tough issue to resolve. No issues otherwise.</p>
