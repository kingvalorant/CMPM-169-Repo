			<h1>Experiment 6 - Grammar and Text Art</h1>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>What are you trying to accomplish with this experiment?</p>
				<p>I wanted to have the ASCII text mimick 12 hour real time format. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?</p>
				<p>I integrated my ASCII alarm clock by retrieving the current time from p5s built-in functions, converting it into a 12-hour format with AM/PM</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</p>
				<p>I ran into some issues testing the 6am alarm clock ringing effect but ended up making sure it works properly. </p>
